<!-- # Note that the above output type is "html_document" instead of PDF, github document, or something else -->
<!-- Also note that the typical "#" does not comment out things in an html document -->
<!-- # toc option = table of contents -->
<!-- In order to run the page, we must knit it -->

# This is Vivian's awesome website

One pound sign is a larger title

## Subsection

Two pound signs is another heading but it looks the same?
 
Note: To render a main homepage html file, we must title it with "index" as the first word

<!-- Maybe the "#" makes a title? -->
